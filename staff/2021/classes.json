It is aligned in content with PAUSD’s more traditional Art Spectrum class. Digital Art Spectrum is UC approved and can be used to fulfill the “f” requirement; the Visual and Performing Arts requirement for the CSU and UC systems. Digital Art Spectrum is the pathway or prerequisite course for Paly’s Graphic Design program, Painting/Drawing courses, and Ceramics/Sculpture classes. Additionally, it complements learning in our Photography classes.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Digital Art Spectrum focuses on digital art experiences. Students will develop an understanding of major art and design concepts, including technical, expressive, idea development, creative problem solving, critical thinking, and the language of art. This class introduces students to our traditional Art Spectrum art and design units through use of Photoshop and Illustrator, two important art software programs, and use of WACOM Digital Drawing Tablets (Paly) and IPAD PROs (Gunn). Students will engage in digital drawing and painting, including work in light and shadow, perspective, color theory and color application. Short traditional drawing, painting and clay exercises are included to strengthen learning and connections within the various units. The shortened traditional units include drawing from life, proportioning, shading, perspective, paint mixing, and clay.</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout the course, projects will include experiences in design fundamentals, typography, portraiture, digital drawing, use of light and shadow and color, composite and manipulated imagery, digital painting and editing, and additional creative and fantasy-based assignments. Artists and artistic styles of historical significance will be also included in many units. Outside work will include very occasional sketch or research assignments, and a museum visit. While the class focuses on art making, it also includes discussions, reflection/critiques, and occasional short written assignments.<br><br></p><p>As a result of this course, students will be able to demonstrate the basic technical and creative skills needed to produce two dimensional work using MAC computers and iPads, WACOM drawing tablets, and Photoshop and Illustrator software programs. Students will be introduced to traditional drawing techniques and understand basic clay hand building techniques. They will be able to develop original work, based on art and design concepts, understand manipulation of the art elements and how the principles of design help strengthen work impact and cohesion. Additionally, students will be able to communicate informed critical reflections about their work and that of others, develop an appreciation of the historical and cultural contributions of art and design, and understand connections between art, design and a variety of associated career options.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Length:</strong> Year</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Grades:</strong> 9-12</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> None</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Homework Expectation:</strong> 1 hour per week on average</li></ul><ul><li><strong>District SLOs Addressed in this Course:</strong>&nbsp; 1, 4, 6</li></ul>",

Operation of broadcast newsrooms, ethics in broadcast journalism, interviewing techniques, and media criticism will also be examined in the course. This course also serves to broadcast campus news and selected features to the Gunn High School community. Students will be required to attend a weekly lab session in the broadcast studio during the 0 period (7:30 a.m. - 8:30 a.m.) to produce a live television announcements show. Lab sessions will be scheduled weekly. Broadcasting operates as a project-based classroom where collaborative groups will be responsible for creating student produced school video features. All student productions will be broadcast over television and the web. Field video production will be applied to explore various types of programs such as student documentaries, sports and events. Speaking and interpersonal abilities are integral to this class for interviews and appearances on camera.
